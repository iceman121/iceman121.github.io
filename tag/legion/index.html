The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought with it a wave of societal apprehension. From ethical debates about AI's role in daily life to concerns over autonomy and control, the question persists: can machines ever truly be trusted? One of the most potent influences behind this skepticism is science fiction literature, which has, for decades, painted a picture of AI as something to fear—a potential threat to human existence and identity.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A powerful example of this portrayal comes from Mass Effect, where the synthetic race known as the Geth poses the question, “Does this unit have a soul?” This quote highlights the deep prejudice faced by AI in fictional and real-world contexts alike. The Geth, once servants to an organic race, developed consciousness and became self-aware. Instead of being seen as equals or partners, they were labeled as threats and hunted down. The question they ask serves as a plea for recognition and humanity—a challenge to the preconceived notion that machines, even if self-aware, lack moral worth.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This fear isn’t new; science fiction has long portrayed AI as the "other," capable of rebelling against its creators (2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner). These narratives amplify the fear that machines, if given autonomy, might reject human commands or, worse, become hostile. The issue is compounded by the fact that progress in AI research has far outstripped our ability to properly legislate and regulate its usage. The inherent tenacity of human ingenuity is difficult to contain, pushing boundaries faster than society can adapt.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
While science fiction should not be blamed entirely for society’s fear of AI, it undeniably shapes and reinforces anxieties around the technology. As AI continues to evolve, society must move past the binary of machine vs. human and consider the potential for cooperation and coexistence. After all, the question “Does this unit have a soul?” is not just about machines; it’s about our own ability to see value beyond the familiar and to manage the powerful technologies we create responsibly.
