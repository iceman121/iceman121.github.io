Title: About me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
By way of introduction, I am Shashwat Pathak.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I have been involved with the Data Analytics industry since 2012. Having worked at several consulting firms over the 
last 12+ years, of which ~7 were at McKinsey & Company, I've played several roles in the Analytics Delivery structure-
starting out as a Data Scientist and occasionally dabbling in Data Engineering, ML Ops and Data Visualization. 
Over time, my role evolved into that of an Analytics Leader, providing execution expertise on short-term projects, 
operational leadership on implementation, deployment and rollout efforts and thought partnership on 
organizational analytics strategy.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Over the course of this journey, I've worked in several industries, most prominent of which have been 
Media and Entertainment, Metals and Mining, Retail and Consumer Goods, and Finance and Asset Management. All of them
have contributed in their own way in enriching my portfolio and preparing me for the next big challenge. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In the hours outside of work, I follow several pursuits like gaming, boxing, forging, chess, etc., of which, I'm sure
I'll talk at some point in these pages. I would love to hear from the readers, and I can be reached on LinkedIn 
for further discussion.
