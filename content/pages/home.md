`What do you call a man with no shins? Tony`

It was finally time to start recording all the different conversations and discussions I have with various people.

Usually, the topics on which I do have something to contribute can be categorized under the topics in the title of\
this website- AI, Python, and Blackjack. Actually not true, but let's be fair- it's catchy. And an argument can be made\
that most topics can broadly be forced into these topics anyway. For the last 20% that love causing chaos- eh, we'll play it by the ear.

Broadly though, I intend to structure discussions as follows-
1. **AI**- Anything to do with Artificial Intelligence. \
&emsp;I am, first and foremost an AI professional, so AI gets first dibs. So this section will have anything between\
&emsp;recent trends, upcoming research, exciting demos- anything between AlphaStar and Skynet
2. **Python**- Probably a better header would be tech, but my philosophy is try to approach everything tech with python.\
&emsp;Incidentally, this website is created, maintained and managed through python too. At the time of writing this,\
&emsp;I am planning to have an article with step-by-step instructions on how you can set up your own website using python\
&emsp;and github
3. **Blackjack**- Fun and games. All games, not just Blackjack. I just included Blackjack because I was fiddling with casino chips\
&emsp;while trying to come up a name for this page, so Blackjack was it. Why Blackjack and not Poker you ask? Poker involves\
&emsp;other people, Blackjack is purely between you and the dealer. It's the perfect way to get lost in a casino\
&emsp;if you want some alone time. I should include a general warning here- I am in no way encouraging gambling, and urge everyone to\
&emsp;use their best judgement when it comes to spending at a casino. Back on topic though, this section can include anything\
&emsp;from Blackjack strategy, chess puzzles, interesting math problems, or even the latest video game that has caught my attention

I will try to post and update as much as I can. I have a list of topics in mind, and a lot to say about those topics, so sit back and I hope you enjoy the ride.
