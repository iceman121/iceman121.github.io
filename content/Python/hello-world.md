Summary: Hello, World!

Hello, World!

If you are here, you are reading my first attempt at publishing this website through a nifty little static page website
manager called Pelican. You'll find links to it all over this website, so have at it. I will, one day in the future,
have an article detailing the steps I went through to publish this page...

... but in the immortal words of Aragorn, today is not that day.
